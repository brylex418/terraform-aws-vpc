# VPC with Outpost Subnet

Configuration in this directory creates a vpc with public / private / and a private outpost subnet.

This configuration uses Availability Zone IDs and Availability Zone names for demonstration purposes. Normally, you need to specify only names or IDs.

[Read more about AWS regions, availability zones and local zones](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/using-regions-availability-zones.html#concepts-regions-availability-zones).

## Usage

To run this example you need to execute:

```bash
$ terraform init
$ terraform plan
$ terraform apply
```

Note that this example may create resources which can cost money (AWS Elastic IP, for example). Run `terraform destroy` when you don't need these resources.
